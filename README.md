# SentiVent (HackDavis 2020)

## Problem
Conducting user research on platforms that UC Davis students use frequently, we found an overwhelming amount of negative responses during their time at the university. One particular feeling we noticed was prevalent among UC Davis students was loneliness. In an effort to help improve the overall emotional health of the student body, we decided to create SentiVent.

## Solution
The user is encouraged to write journal entries on SentiVent. Journaling is a healthy expression of emotions, and has been proven to help with gaining control of one’s emotions and overall improve mental health. SentiVent is much more than a simple journaling app. Based on keywords the user has written in their journal entries and based on a user’s location, SentiVent will curate a list of resources the user can utilize to improve their mental health. This app utilizes the Google Cloud Natural Language API.
